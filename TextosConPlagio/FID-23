There is currently a good response to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in sectors such as industrial control and smart homes. However, artificial intelligence technologies have specific requirements for computer applications, and also face challenges in cyber security, data analysis, human-computer interaction, etc. Currently, the arena of embedded systems has achieved impressive results in terms of performance, but their development has been seriously hindered factors such as low development efficiency and unsustainable system performance. The test results show that, among other variables, students and experts gave 83.5% and 90% positive ratings for the system, respectively 16.5% and 10% negative ratings. In this paper, an EP Vision System (VS) based on AI technology is proposed. This component combines a hardware model with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to perform intelligent robot interactions and target recognition. This provides a comprehensive overview of AI strategy and EPVS. System X had a higher proportion of positive ratings than system Y, which indicates that the system, however, system Y had only 19% and 4% of positive ratings, while 81% and 96% of negative ratings; However, the positive rating of Formula Y was only 19% and 4% respectively, while the negative ratings were 81% and 96% respectively.
