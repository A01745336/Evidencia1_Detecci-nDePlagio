The utilization of AI and machine learning, specifically employing the vision transformer technique, for bacterial detection offers a promising solution to address the limitations encountered with traditional methods. This approach provides faster and more precise identification of pathogenic bacteria like E. coli and salmonella in water, which is critical for human health and well-being. Ongoing research aims to further evaluate its efficacy in the field of microbiology. This study introduces an innovative positional self-attention transformer model designed for bacterial colony classification. Building upon the success of transformer architectures in diverse domains, we have enhanced the model's performance by incorporating a positional self-attention mechanism. Our novel approach leverages this positional self-attention transformer model to effectively capture spatial relationships and patterns within bacterial colonies, resulting in highly accurate classification outcomes. By training the model on a large dataset of bacterial images, we ensure its robustness and ability to generalize across various colony types. The proposed model adeptly captures the intricate spatial relationships and sequential patterns inherent in bacterial colony images, leading to superior classification accuracy. With an impressive classification accuracy of 98.50%, our approach surpasses conventional methods by effectively capturing subtle morphological variations within microbial structures. The model's adaptability to diverse colony shapes and arrangements represents a significant advancement, promising to redefine bacterial colony classification through cutting-edge deep learning techniques. The notable accuracy achieved by our model suggests its potential for practical applications in early disease diagnosis and targeted treatment development. These findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating positional self-attention into transformer models for image-based classification tasks, particularly in the realm of bacterial colony analysis.
