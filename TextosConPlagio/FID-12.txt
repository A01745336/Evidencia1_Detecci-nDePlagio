The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in the field of education has seen a significant increase, resulting in a surge of published research. However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive, large-scale reviews in this domain. This study aims to fill this gap by analyzing 4,519 publications spanning from 2000 to 2019. It employs topic-based bibliometrics to uncover trends and themes related to the application of AI in education (AIEd). The findings reveal a growing interest within the academic community in leveraging AI for educational purposes. Key research areas include the development of intelligent tutoring systems for special education, the application of natural language processing in language education, the use of educational robots for teaching AI concepts, the utilization of educational data mining for predicting student performance, discourse analysis in computer-supported collaborative learning environments, the implementation of neural networks for evaluating teaching methods, the incorporation of affective computing for detecting learner emotions, and the utilization of recommender systems for personalized learning experiences. Additionally, the study discusses the challenges faced and outlines potential future directions for AIEd research.
