Machine learning (ML) is a form of artificial intelligence that is poised to transform the 21st century. Recent rapid progress in its architecture and underlying algorithms and growth in data set sizes have led to increased computing competition in a variety of fields. For these algorithms, choosing an appropriate fitness function plays an important role. These include driving a vehicle, language translation, chatbots, and beyond human performance in complex board games like Go. Here, we review the fundamentals and algorithms behind machine learning and highlight specific approaches to learning and optimization. We then summarize the applications of ML to medicine. The fitness function guides the search strategy of the algorithms to obtain the best solutions. Feature selection (FS) is an optimization problem that reduces the dimensionality of the data set and increases the performance of machine learning and classification algorithms by selecting optimal features from the subset and removing redundant features.
