Remote healthcare applications based on the Internet of Things (IoT) have revolutionized the delivery of fast and preventive medical services to at-risk patients. However, accurately predicting heart disease has remained a challenging task, often resulting in less-than-ideal diagnosis outcomes. In response to this challenge, a new Recommendation System for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Using IoT Network (DEEP-CARDIO) has been introduced to offer proactive diagnosis, treatment, and dietary guidance for cardiac conditions. Initially, physiological data is collected remotely from patients using four biosensors: ECG sensor, Pressure sensor, Pulse sensor, and Glucose sensor. An Arduino controller receives this data from the IoT sensors to predict and diagnose diseases. A BiGRU (Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Unit) attention model is employed to implement a cardiovascular disease prediction model, which categorizes the disease into five distinct cardiovascular classes. Subsequently, the recommendation system delivers personalized physical and dietary recommendations to cardiac patients via a mobile application, based on the classified data. The performance of DEEP-CARDIO is assessed using CloudSim, a cloud simulator, with real-time datasets such as Framinghamâ€™s and Statlog heart disease dataset. The proposed DEEP CARDIO approach achieves an impressive overall accuracy of 99.90%, surpassing the accuracies of other methods such as MABC-SVM (86.91%), HCBDA (88.65%), and MLbPM (93.63%).
