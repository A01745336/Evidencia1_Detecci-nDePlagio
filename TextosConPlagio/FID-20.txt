The digital realm has unveiled itself as an exhilarating frontier for human-computer interaction (HCI) and virtual cooperation. This manuscript embarks on a thorough exploration of this digital landscape, aiming to bridge the gap present in current literature by offering a comprehensive survey of the metaverse from a human-centered standpoint. Initially, we consolidate existing literature to formulate a concise definition of the metaverse, unraveling its intrinsic affordances. Subsequently, we unveil an intricate framework that encompasses the essence of the metaverse, encompassing its foundational infrastructure technologies and the diverse array of input/output technologies facilitating immersive HCI experiences. Delving into various domains, we illuminate the manifold applications of the metaverse and the potential it holds. Each component within this framework is meticulously elucidated, providing profound insights into the nature of the metaverse and the technological advancements shaping its landscape. Through this meticulous analysis, we uncover prominent challenges and propose avenues for further exploration, igniting the pursuit of novel solutions. By delineating the vision for the metaverse and delineating the requisite building blocks, this study offers indispensable insights, serving as a beacon for developers and researchers committed to propelling this transformative digital frontier forward.
