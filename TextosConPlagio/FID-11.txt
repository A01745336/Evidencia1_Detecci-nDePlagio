installed on the modern intelligent vehicles. Many Artificial Intelligence based foundation models have been proposed for smart sensing to recognize the known object classes in the new but similar scenarios. However, it is still challenging for the foundation models of smart sensing to detect all the object classes in both seen and unseen scenarios.  The advent of autonomous vehicles has heralded a transformative era in transportation, reshaping the landscape of mobility through cutting-edge technologies. Central to this evolution is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and learning algorithms, propelling vehicles into realms of unprecedented autonomy.
