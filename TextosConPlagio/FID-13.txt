Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently become a very popular buzzword, as a consequence of disruptive technical advances and impressive experimental results, notably in the field of image analysis and processing. In medicine, specialties where images are central, like radiology, pathology or oncology, have seized the opportunity.  Serious video games provide a immersive learning environment for agriculture by simulating real-life challenges scenarios. However, empirical evidence of their effectiveness is sparse. This scoping review follows PRISMA-ScR guidelines to summarize literature on serious video games for agricultural learning, highlighting research trends.
